<p>The tutorial explains how to remotely login to a lab PC using a ssh key and access a computer in the PCPOOL in building 27. On the lab PCs Ubuntu 18.04.5 is running.</p>

<p>For Windows 10 users the use of PuTTY is recommended. PuTTY is a SSH client, that has the capability to generate ssh keys.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> on your computer.</li>
<li>Generate a key pair PuTTYgen, a key generator that is installed along with PuTTY.</li>
</ol>

<em>Figure 1: Generare 2048 bit RSA keys</em></p>
<p>2.1 The keys have to be RSA keys with 2048 bits. Copy the key inside the window (see figure 1) in PuTTYgen named <em>“Public key for pasting into openSSH”</em>, paste it into your E-Mail client and send the key to Harald Schernthanner (<a href="mailto:hschernt@uni-potsdam.de">hschernt@uni-potsdam.de</a>)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Save the private key. Important: always keep your private key and <strong>never</strong> handout your private key!</p></li>
<li><p>Harald Schernthanner generates an account for you, puts your key on the system, contacts you, when your account is ready and tells you your username and the IP of your machine.</p></li>
<li><p>When the account is ready, please login using PuTTY. In PuTTY you just have to tell the programm the path to the private key: <code>ssh -&gt; connection -&gt; auth</code></p></li>
</ol>

<ol type="1">
<li>Open a terminal and execute <code>ssh-keygen</code>.</li>
<li><p>You will be asked to <em>Enter file in which to save the key (/home/administrator/.ssh/id_rsa): </em> Define a folder and filename e.g. <em>/home/yourusername/yourkeyname</em> When you are asked to enter a passphrase: leave it blank by pressing enter (we don’t necessarily need a passphrase for the public key). This generates two files: First the private key; please keep it in a save place and second the public key named yourkeyname.pub).</p></li>
<li><p>Send the public key to hschernt@uni-potsdam.de</p></li>
<li><p>The administrator Harald Schernthanner(hschernt@uni-potsdam.de) generates an account for you, puts your key on the system, contacts you, when your account is ready and tells you your username and the IP of your machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Login with <code>$ssh -i yourkeyname yourusername@141.89.113.170</code>. After the -i flag you have to define <strong>the path to your private key</strong>, then the access without password should be possible.</p></li>
